/* 

For smaller components, there is the components/ folder. While layout/ is macro (defining the global wireframe), components/ is more focused on widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of files in components/ since the whole site/application should be mostly composed of tiny modules.
